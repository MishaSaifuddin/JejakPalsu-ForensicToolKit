# 🔍 JejakPalsu – Fake Receipt & Document Forensic Detection System

JejakPalsu is a **web-based digital forensic tool** designed to automatically detect **forged receipts and fake documents** using image processing, OCR, and noise analysis techniques.  
This project addresses real-world challenges in **financial fraud, document forgery, and digital evidence verification**, making it highly relevant for cybersecurity and digital forensic roles 🔐.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of digital fraud involving **fake receipts, invoices, and altered documents**, manual verification has become inefficient and error-prone.  
**JejakPalsu** provides an automated forensic solution to identify manipulation indicators such as:

- Font inconsistencies
- Cloned or duplicated logos
- Abnormal noise patterns
- Metadata irregularities

The system is built using **Python for backend processing** and **HTML/CSS for the frontend**, enabling investigators, auditors, and non-technical users to perform forensic checks easily through a web interface.
